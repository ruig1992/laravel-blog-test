# Simple Personal Laravel Blog with extra features

## The test task:

1. Set up latest Laravel. This should be done on a branch **'master'**.
1. Create the blog on its base (any from the internet that you find can be used, or you can write a basic one yourself, doesn't really matter). This should be done as a separate branch, based on master. Let's call it **'laravel_blog'**.

1. On the article edit page there should be two buttons:
    - ***'search image'***, that searches random image in Internet (you can use any API you like) by article title, and shows one without a page reload. Each time you click it - a random picture from google images should be displayed next to it.
    - ***'insert image'*** - inserts image tag with the image 'found' by first button in the beginning of the article.

    (this should be a separate branch with **'laravel_blog'** as a base, let's call it **'image_buttons'**).

So in the end there should be 3 branches: `image_buttons <- laravel_blog <- master`

Please use Laravel tools as much as possible.

Provide the result as a git repository (in github or bitbucket).
